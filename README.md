# Database Management of Netflix

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create comprehensive data models for storing and managing Netflix's customer and content data. This involves the development of relational, dimensional, and entity-relationship (E-R) data models using Lucidchart for visualization and SQL for database implementation. The objective is to analyze customer subscription behavior and provide insights that will help Netflix make informed business decisions and recommendations. The project includes implementing Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements and executing queries based on specific business requirements.

## Key Components
### Data Models Development:

#### Relational Data Model: 
Establishing tables and relationships to represent Netflix's data in a structured format. This model ensures data normalization and reduces redundancy.

#### Dimensional Data Model: 
Creating star and snowflake schemas to facilitate efficient querying and reporting. This model is essential for online analytical processing (OLAP) and helps in understanding patterns in customer behavior.

#### Entity-Relationship (E-R) Data Model: 
Designing an E-R diagram using Lucidchart to visualize entities, attributes, and relationships. This model serves as a blueprint for constructing the database and understanding the data flow.

### Customer and Content Data:

#### Customer Data: 
Includes personal details, subscription plans, viewing history, and payment information.

#### Content Data: 
Encompasses information about movies, TV shows, genres, ratings, and availability in different regions.

### Analyzing Customer Subscription Behavior:

#### Behavior Analysis: 
Examining patterns such as subscription renewal rates, viewing preferences, and peak usage times.

### Business Decision Support:

#### Recommendation System: 
Using data insights to recommend content tailored to individual customer preferences.

#### Marketing Strategies: 
Crafting targeted marketing campaigns based on customer demographics and behavior.

### Implementing DDL and DML:

DDL (Data Definition Language): Creating and modifying database structures such as tables, indexes, and constraints using SQL.
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data within the database using SQL.
Performing Queries:

### Business Requirement Queries: Executing specific queries to generate reports and dashboards. Examples include:
Top 10 most-watched shows.
Monthly active users.
Average viewing time per customer.
Revenue generated by different subscription plans.
Tools and Technologies
Data Modeling Tool: Lucidchart for creating E-R diagrams and data models.
Database Management: SQL for writing DDL and DML statements.
Expected Outcomes
Comprehensive Data Models: Well-structured relational, dimensional, and E-R models for Netflix's data.
Actionable Insights: Detailed analysis of customer behavior and content performance.
Improved Business Decisions: Data-driven strategies for enhancing customer satisfaction and business growth.
Effective Data Management: Robust database structures and efficient data manipulation capabilities.
